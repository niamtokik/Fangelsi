# fangelsi

Yet another FreeBSD/DragonFlyBSD jail manager

## Project goals

 * Easy way to interconnect jails with network feature
 * Easy way to learn commands from scratch
 * Highly compatible with FreeBSD generic tools

## Proof of Concept

First PoC was made in shell, long time ago. Next in Perl,
and finaly... In shell.

## Final version?

I need something more efficient and low level. I was thinking
to make different jail library for:

 * Perl
 * Erlang/Elixir
 * Ocaml
 * Go

Each one in C or C++. 

## State

Doesn't have time to make this project alive. So. Only testing
branch!
